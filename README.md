# 🧠 AI-Driven Nuclear Intelligence

This is a 3-day multidisciplinary research project focused on analyzing global nuclear energy production, uranium safety, and energy-related mortality trends using:

- SQL for data extraction and analysis
- Python for data wrangling and machine learning
- Data Warehousing for structured schema design
- Power BI for impactful dashboarding and storytelling

---

## 🎯 Goal

This project is part of my personal journey and commitment toward applying for a **PhD in Data Science** with a focus on AI and neurogenics. While this is not yet part of a PhD program, it is intended to demonstrate my ability to lead independent, interdisciplinary, data-driven research.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Data/`: Raw and cleaned datasets
- `SQL/`: Schema + Analytical queries
- `Python/`: Notebooks for data processing and ML
- `PowerBI/`: Dashboard file
- `docs/`: Project plan, ER diagrams, reference files

---

## 🚧 Status

Currently under active development:

- ✅ Git and folder structure set up
- 🟡 Step 1: Data Profiling + SQL Analysis (in progress)
- 🔜 Step 2: ER Diagram + Star Schema Design
- 🔜 Step 3: Python Modeling + Power BI Storytelling
